   This section describes the process for obtaining a copy of the RabbitMQ
   Java AMQP client source code, as well as instructions for building the
   Java client from source.

  Table of Contents

     * Obtaining the source
     * Required Libraries and Tools
     * Building the Java client libraries

Obtaining the source

     * Either download a released source code distribution from the download
       page, or
     * Check the code out directly from our mercurial repositories:

 $ hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-codegen
 $ hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-java-client
 $ cd rabbitmq-java-client
 $ ant dist

   If you choose to check the code out using mercurial, be aware that the
   code-generation module is a dependency of the Java client library. If
   you're working with a released source code distribution, though, the
   code-generation module is included.

Required Libraries and Tools

   In order to build RabbitMQ Java AMQP client library, you will need a few
   tools.

   The Java client libraries requires a recent version of Python and
   simplejson.py (an implementation of a JSON reader and writer in Python),
   for generating AMQP framing code. simplejson.py is included as a standard
   json library in the Python core since 2.6 release.

   Additionally, for building the Java client libraries, you will need

     * a Java compiler, for Java language version 1.5 or newer
     * Ant, version 1.6 or newer, including the optional ant-trax.jar (if you
       download ant from the above then this is included; if you are using
       the ant Debian/Ubuntu package then you also need to install the
       ant-optional package).

Building the Java client libraries

   Ensure JAVA_HOME is correctly set. Change to the rabbitmq-java-client
   directory and type ant.

   Other interesting build.xml targets include

   build
           The default target. Builds the client library classes into
           build/classes.

   clean
           Removes the entire build directory, including compiled classes,
           built jar files, and any distributions placed under build/dist.

   jar
           Builds a jar file from the client library classes into build/lib.

   dist
           Constructs a directory, by default build/dist, containing the
           RabbitMQ Java AMQP client jar files as well as all the libraries
           the AMQP client depends on from lib. The distribution output
           directory can be overridden by setting the Ant property dist.out
           to a new location:

           ant -Ddist.out=/some/place/to/put/a/distribution dist
